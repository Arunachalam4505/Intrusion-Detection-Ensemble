# Intrusion-Detection-Ensemble
Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security
A massive amount of work has been conducted in the field of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which is used to identify various attacks on the network. Various machine learning approaches have been carried out to prevent malware attacks or network intrusion by attackers. Single classifiers have several limitations which cause low performance in the classification of normal attacks and anomalies. In other words, they are not strong enough to create a good Intrusion Detection System (IDS).  This is a reason researchers have the idea of building ensemble models to take advantage of different models in combination together. The main goal of using ensemble classifiers is to achieve higher accuracy and Lower False Alarm Rate (FAR) will be provided. Two ensemble learning techniques â€“ Voting and Stacking based models are implemented with PSO optimizer to obtain weights.
